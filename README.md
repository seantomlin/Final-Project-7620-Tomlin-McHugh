# Final-Project-7620-Tomlin-McHugh

This project will contain the code for our data generating processes and working methods. This is an R-project, so you should be able to open it in R studio to make changes, commit, and push to the remote repo.

# To Do Items

1.  Write R script with working methods for estimating the ATE. We're working with BART, BART-PS, Linear model, GRF, and BCF at the moment.
2.  Write R script to simulate L=500 datasets with estimated ATEs, bias, SE, empirical coverage.
